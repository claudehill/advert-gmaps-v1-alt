    <h3 class="pt-4 pb-2 text-center">A Personal Perspective</h3>

    <p>
      As a restaurateur or other small business owner with a traditional “brick-and-mortar” business, few things are more frustrating to your potential customers than not knowing how to find the location of your business. On the internet, you only have a few minutes (at
      best) to capture the attention of your potential clientele before someone else gets it.
      <br />
      <br />To illustrate:
    </p>

    <div class="quote-offset">
      <p>Recently, my spouse and I decided to experiment and try a trendy, local, upscale non-chain restaurant. Since we rarely have evenings where we can enjoy a cozy upscale dinner together, we were both very excited to view the menu and check out the ambiance of the restaurant.</p>

      <p>After a few minutes of glancing at the menu to see what I might like, I was convinced - I had to check this place out. So, I navigated to the “Contact Us” Page. However, when I tried clicking the map to get driving directions, I was quickly met with the error “This page cannot display Google maps,” followed by a “for Development purposes only” watermark over the map, preventing me from panning, zooming or getting directions from my location.</p>

      <div class="img-container text-center pb-4">
        <img src="../assets/img/gmap_error.png" alt="Google Maps error" srcset class="img-fluid" />
        <small>Google and the Google logo are registered trademarks of Google LLC, used with permission.</small>
      </div>

      <p>Needless to say, my enthusiasm turned immediately to frustration. As someone who is “directionally challenged,” Google maps has always provided straightforward, easy to navigate directions. For an upscale restaurant like this to not provide directions (in my opinion) suggested apathy and incompetence.</p>

      <p>I began to wonder, “if the restaurant can’t even provide directions, will the same apathy come through with the food?... and what about the service?... is the management even aware of this?” My suspicions gave way to doubt, and my doubt caused me to immediately look for another dining option. Not wanting to risk having a “less-than-exceptional” experience, especially for the upscale price point, I decided to try another restaurant.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Most customers will not reveal their frustrations with the level of transparency described above, so it is critical that nothing separates you from your ability to gain new customers - including your own website.
      This is especially true if your restaurant concept, core product offering or service is geared toward upscale clientele.
    </p>

    <p>
      As

      >evidence continues to mount that we are heading into a deep recession</a>, the competition for your client base will continue to grow. Having clear directions to your restaurant or business, coupled with a good marketing strategy that fosters both loyalty and growth will help you remain profitable in any economic climate.

    <h3 class="text-center">Why You're Seeing This Google Maps Error on your Small Business Website</h3>
    <p>
      On June 22, 2016,
      <a
        href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-google-maps-platform.html"
        target="_blank"
      >Google announced</a> that
      <a
        href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/building-for-scale-updates-to-google/"
        target="_blank"
      >they would be removing keyless API usage (more on that later)</a>. Additional changes came on June 11, 2018, when Google announced that users would “ … need a valid API key and a Google Cloud Platform billing account to access our core products,” which, as you might have guessed, included Google Maps.
    </p>

    <p>The net effect of these changes have caused major headaches for small business owners who do not keep their websites maintained. Why? Well, as a small business web design and development consultant for many years, it has been my experience that the mindset of small business owners is such that they do NOT view their website as something that needs continual investment. They view it as a static asset; that is, “just build me a website and it’ll run forever.” This mistaken assumption can prove to be very costly.</p>
    <p>For example, many business owners have contacted us because they've experienced disruption in sales due to Wordpress extensions being so outdated that they become unstable. They incorrectly assume that once the Wordpress site is up and running, no other action is needed.</p>

    <p>In the case of Google Maps, both the removal of keyless API usage and the requirement of a Google Cloud billing account means that if you used the Google Maps ecosystem a few years ago but didn’t make any updates to your account and the code that utilizes these changes, your site won’t work properly.</p>


    <h3 class="text-center">
      A Little Background Info ...
      <br />What the heck is an API Anyway?
    </h3>
    <p>First of all, what is an API? API is an acronym that stands for Application Programming Interface. Put simply, an API allows one piece of software (the “caller”) to request and obtain data from another piece of software without knowing the internal mechanisms of the system providing that data. This is done through a set of rules called HTTP (or, HyperText Transfer Protocol).</p>
    <p>As long as the calling system requests the data in the right way, the system providing the data will continue to send the data that was requested. Problems arise, however, when the system supplying the data changes the rules (called parameters) of how to obtain the data.</p>

    <p>In 2016, when Google began requiring an API key to access Google Maps, this was actually an additional, mandatory parameter that was required to obtain the data - i.e., the map and/or driving directions to your place of business. Without it, the previous request became invalid, thus resulting in an error on your website without this parameter.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Why Do I Need an API Key?</h3>

    <p>To help understand why certain data providers require API keys, it is helpful to examine the problem from another perspective. An API key uniquely identifies both the user and/or application that wants to access the data. Most companies who provide value-added services in the form of API’s want to ensure continuity and preserve the integrity of their systems.</p>
    <p>For Data Providers like Google, knowing who is requesting their data and how much data each user is consuming helps them to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prevent excessive use - resulting in DoS (Denial of Service) for other users</li>
      <li>Charge users appropriately based on the amount of data (similar to utility companies)</li>
      <li>Quickly identify suspicious activity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Google is no exception. By requiring users to sign up for an API key and also Google Cloud (which requires billing methods enabled) they are able to charge money in exchange for displaying a Map or Driving Directions to your business on your website.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Deciding which Google Maps APIs are Required for your Small Business</h3>

    <p>If you currently have Google Maps API errors (such as the one listed above) on your website, this may be a good time to stop and re-evaluate which Google APIs are truly needed in order to not only fix the problem, but to best direct your customers to your place of business.</p>
    <p>Listed below is a brief summary of the various Google Maps APIs that are offered, and a brief explanation of the role each API plays in directing customers to your place of business.</p>

    <h4 class="text-center">Google Maps API</h4>

    <p>The Google Maps API is the one that users are probably most familiar with. By sending a request to a Google server, a visible map is then displayed on the web page that shows the user’s current location. In addition to the map itself, markers can be placed on the map which show visual points of interest, or other important details in relation to the user's current location.</p>

    <h4 class="text-center">Google Geocoding API</h4>

    <p>The Google Geocoding API is one that is probably less well-known to users, but even more important from a machine standpoint. The Google Geocoding API takes a human-readable address and converts it to a set of latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>
    <p>The Google Geocoding API can also do the reverse process or, more commonly, what is known as reverse geocoding. Reverse geocoding is the process of taking a set of coordinates such as latitude and longitude and converting them into a human readable address.</p>
    <p>In software applications where the end-user may be traveling, both forward and reverse Geolocation API calls are generally required to process origin and destination addresses versus a user's location in real time.</p>

    <h4 class="text-center">Google Directions API</h4>

    <p>Finally, the Google directions API utilizes a combination of both the Google Maps API as well as the Google Geocoding API. This API is used for calculating and displaying directions in real-time for driving, cycling, Transit, or walking to or from a given location.</p>
    <p>The Google directions API comes in two flavors. There is a basic request and there is an advanced request. The advanced request includes additional features not present on the basic request such as real-time traffic monitoring, as well as the ability to add multiple waypoints.</p>
    <p>However, the advanced directions API does not come without additional cost. As of the time of this writing the cost for the basic Google directions API cost 0.005 whereas the cost for the advanced Google directions API cost 0.010 per request. Well this may not seem like a lot of money on the surface, when multiple users begin requesting APIs multiple times in a very short time span this can become quite costly for the person paying for the API - meaning, you the business owner.</p>
    <p>So you need to be selective when choosing which APIs you want to utilize for your website. Carefully weigh the cost of each API that you need vs. the benefit that each API will provide to both your end-users and to your business as a whole. doing this will ensure that you are keeping costs in while maximizing the benefits to your customers - thus, ensuring profitability.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Adding Google Maps to your Website Using Google Maps APIs</h3>

    <p>After you've decided which APIs will work best for your restaurant or small business, its time to get to work. This section will be split up into 2 sections - Wordpress users, and non-Wordpress users.</p>

    <p>However, regardless of whether you have a Wordpress&reg; website or not, there are 4 basic steps that need to be followed to integrate Google Maps API(s) into your website:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Go to the
        <a
          href="https://console.developers.google.com/"
          target="_blank"
        >Google Developers Console</a> to sign up for billing, and specify an app or project that will use the API/APIs
      </li>
      <li>Pick the API/APIs needed for your project.</li>
      <li>Obtain an API key for your project</li>
      <li>Integrate the Google Maps code into Wordpress&reg; or your Website</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-center">In Conclusion</h3>

    <p>We hope you found the preceeding information useful. As a final consideration, remember that as a restaurateur / small business owner, your time is extremely limited and very valuable.</p>
    <p>
      So,
      ask yourself ...
      <em>"would my time be best spent designing a website and fixing errors, or investing that time to make my restaurant or small business more profitable?"</em>
    </p>

    <p>The point here, is that we often advise small business owners who are NOT tech savvy to simply stick to what they're good at.</p>
    <p>
      If the steps outlined above seem too much to take on yourself, it is best to outsource the work to a skilled Web Designer &amp; Developer (or better yet, a team of Web Designers &amp; Developers) that understands what is needed and can get you up and running quickly. At
